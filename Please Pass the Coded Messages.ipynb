    "You need to pass a message to the bunny workers, but to avoid detection, the code you agreed to use is... obscure, to say the least. The bunnies are given food on standard-issue plates that are stamped with the numbers `0-9` for easier sorting, and you need to combine sets of plates to create the numbers in the code. The signal that a number is part of the code is that it is `divisible by 3`. You can do smaller numbers like 15 and 45 easily, but bigger numbers like 144 and 414 are a little trickier. Write a program to help yourself `quickly create large numbers` for use in the code, given a limited number of plates to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have L, a list containing some digits `(0 to 9)`. Write a function solution(L) which `finds the largest number` that can be made from some or all of these digits and is `divisible by 3`. If it is not possible to make such a number, `return 0` as the solution. L will contain anywhere from 1 to 9 digits.  The same digit may appear multiple times in the list, but each element in the list may only be used once.\n",
